# Docker image configurations
#

# Project build images
#
# Generally needed to start making containers (a space separated queue of builds)
# and are the default docker builds built with the flow init command.
# Change this if your build image has a different name, or if it has different
# parent images that need building.
#
# @NOTE you don't technically need any of these. If you use a project container that
#   is built on a remote image, then the image will be pulled when you build your
#   project image.
# @NOTE is you want to use this, you will have to create a folder with a Dockerfile
#   for each build, in one of the \${path_builds} folders
# @NOTE this is not something that is heavily enforced.  This is checked during
#   \"./flow init\" but not before starting any builds
#
# @TODO make build check this before proceeding.
#required_builds=\"${required_builds:-""}\"

# Project build and image
#
# which build (folder) should be used for project images (if it isn't built)
# Set this if you put a folder with a Dockerfile in ./builds
project_build=\"${project_build:-${project_name}}\"
# which image should we use for creating containers (and build if it is missing)
project_image=\"${project_image:-${project_name}}\"
# which image version/tag should we build/use for containers
project_imageversion=\"${project_imageversion:-"latest"}\"

# @NOTE you can change the image/version values on the fly to branch your work
#       and start working on a different image set,  Alternatively, you can used
#       a different container by passing a container name into many of the commands

###
# Docker Container configurations
#

# what username gets used inside the machine (for ssh and shell access mainly)
machine_username=\"${machine_username:-root}\"

# OS hostname used inside the container (which would impact things like avahi)
machine_hostname=\"\${project_name}\"

# Machine arguments for regular container runs.  These arguments are added to all runs (except shell runs)
# @NOTE these are arguments for \"docker run\". Check that docker command to learn more
machine_runargs=\"--tty\" # --tty is needed for supervisord to run.

###
# Prefered shell configuration for the Machine
#
# Running as a shell is a temporary approach to getting shell access to a machine
# but should be considered secondary to other methods of running commands on the
# container.  It is a good tool for now but may be dropped in the future.
#
# @NOTE Running a shell creates a new container, but does not give access to an existing container
#       It is not a replacement for ssh, but rather gives access to a sandbox.
#machine_shell=\"/bin/bash\"
# arguments for docker run that should always be included when starting a shell: docker help run
# @NOTE you should probably take a look at docker run to learn more
# You may want to add TTY environment variables such as --env HOME=/root
#machine_shellrunargs=\"--publish-all=true --user=${machine_username}\"

###
# Mount list:
#
# These are run time mounts, where the host FS can be changed
# directly changing the container FS.
#

# Example of how to add a live mount for docker containers
#settings_mount_addmount \"some/path/on/the/host:/some/path/on/the/container\"
