dev_dotssh

A folder that will become the container developer user's .ssh folder.  This means that
you can put in her ssh keys that the container can use to reach various production
and acceptance servers, and you can add your own public key to 'authorized_keys' to
allow passwordless logins to the container.

-Generate ssh keys
(make sure that you select this folder for destination)
$/> ssh-keygen

-Passwordless logins into container
host/> cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub > dev_dotssh/authorized_keys

* Another options is to add a mount, that mounts your user pub key, into the authorized keys path
