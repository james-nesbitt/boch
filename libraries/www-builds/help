This library is a collection of other libraries that are meant to give
access to www server builds.  The www libs are various docker builds
that have been collected as a part of the project.

Note that this library, and the related build libraries are not really
needed after a project has been initialized.  Each build library should
give a project enough settings and pieces to run without the library
after the init flow has been executed.
