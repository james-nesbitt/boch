WHY DO I HAVE A DOCKER INSIDE A DOCKER?

Originally this project setup was configured to run from a
public docker chain (a box I built.)  I decided to include the
configuration of that box here to be more complete.

This is actually 2 docker boxes merged together, but it provides
a CENTOS box, with nginx/mariadb/php-fpm, as well as a 'developer'
user with full sudo, and zsh.
This box runs with supervisor, but includes a shell.sh script that
you can use to run it as a shell.

You should only need to build this once on your machine.  After you
build it once, all of your projects will be based on the same image
