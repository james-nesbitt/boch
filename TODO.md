= TODO LIST =

== DOCUMENTATION ==

1. document the help system
2. document the flow system

== FLOW ==

1. make a way to determine if a flow exists
2. make a way to list all of the flows

3. make some interesting flows, that might make this system worth using  :P

= BUG LIST =

It's actually pretty clean right now, the only problem is that it suffers
overusage of hooks and abstraction (which was kind of the goal)
