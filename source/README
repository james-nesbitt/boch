The source folder is a place for you to keep your project specific
source code.  Here you can check out a git repo, or just put the code.
You can have any arrangment of files, but you should change the nginx
configuration file, if you have your project web-root any place other
than : /source/www

If you have more than one host, put them all in here, and duplicate
that nginx conf file as often as needed.
